A comprehensive collection of fundamental data structure implementations in C. This repository aims to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented examples for learning and practical use. 🚀

## About The Project

This repository serves as a foundational resource for understanding and implementing various data structures from scratch. Each data structure is implemented in C, focusing on clarity, correctness, and efficiency. Whether you're a student learning about data structures or a developer looking for reference implementations, this project aims to be a valuable asset.

**Current Focus**: All implementations are done in **C**.

**Future Vision**: I plan to expand this collection to include implementations in other popular programming languages such as **Python** 🐍 and **JavaScript** 📜, making it a truly multi-language resource for data structure concepts.

## Features

Currently, the repository includes robust implementations of the following fundamental data structures:

*   🔗 **Linked List**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
*   📦 **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
*   🛒 **Queue**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
*   🌳 **Trees**: BST & AVL tree
